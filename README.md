# **Simple Calculator With Jokes Using Servlet And JSP**

Creating a simple calculator with Jokes using JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlet is a great way to demonstrate the basic functionality of web applications in Java. In this project, we will build a web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## **Project Description**

### **Objective**

To create a web-based calculator with some jokes that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations and History functionality.

### **Technologies Used**

Java
Servlet
JSP (JavaServer Pages)
HTML
CSS 
JavaScript

### **Project Features**

User Interface: Design a simple and user-friendly web interface for the calculator using HTML and CSS. You can create input fields, buttons for digits and operations, and a display area to show the result.

Servlet: Create a Servlet to handle user requests and perform the calculations. The Servlet should be responsible for parsing user input, executing the requested operation, and sending the result back to the JSP page.

JSP Page: Create a JSP page that serves as the calculator's user interface. The JSP page should contain HTML for the layout and form elements for user input. When users click buttons or submit the form, the JSP page should send the data to the Servlet for processing.

Operations: Implement the basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Error Handling: Implement error handling to deal with invalid input, such as dividing by zero or non-numeric input.

### **Project Flow**

User visits the web page (the html page) where the calculator is displayed.

User enters numbers and selects an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /).

User clicks the "Calculate" button.

The html page sends the user's input to the Servlet.

The Servlet parses the input, performs the calculation, and sends the result to the JSP page.

The JSP page displays the result with the joke on the screen.

The history functionality, if you click on the history button, the JSP page will open and a list of history will be shown. For the history implementation session management is used.

### **Project Implementation Steps**

Create a Java web project in your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Design the user interface using HTML and CSS.

Create a Servlet to handle user requests and perform calculations.

Create a JSP page for the calculator interface.

Implement the logic for parsing user input and performing calculations in the Servlet.

Handle errors gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid input.

Test the calculator thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

Deploy the web application to a web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat).
